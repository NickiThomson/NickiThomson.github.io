<h1> Nicki Thomson - Biography </h1>
<p> Origianlly hailing from the Washington DC area, Nicki Thomson is currently a sophomore at Tufts University studying Computer Engineering (because she found that Mechanical Engineering was too yucky). When she isn't in Halligan coding and problem setting away, she can be found ballroom dancing, rereading something on her kindle, or jamming with the Tufts Opera Ensemble. </p>
<p>Prior to Tufts, Nicki attended six years of boarding school on a cliffside in England, where she wishes she completed her OWLs and NEWTs but instead just took GCSEs and A Levels like a muggle.
</p>
<p> Nicki is looking forward to two more great years at Tufts before she hopefully continues on to grad school to learn about something even more interesting than Transfiguation or Potions. </p>
